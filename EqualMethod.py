# Python automatically calls the __eq__ method of a class when you use the == operator to compare the instances of the class. By default, Python uses the is operator if you donâ€™t provide a specific implementation for the __eq__ method.

# The following shows how to implement the __eq__ method in the Person class that returns True if two person objects have the same age:

class Person:
    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.age = age

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.age == other.age
# Code language: Python (python)
# Now, if you compare two instances of the Person class with the same age, it returns True:

john = Person('John', 'Doe', 25)
jane = Person('Jane', 'Doe', 25)
print(john == jane)  # True
